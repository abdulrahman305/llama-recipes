      "The architecture consists of the following components:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Facebook Business Page: The page where customers interact with the chatbot.\n",
      "*   Messenger Platform: The platform that handles user messages and sends webhook events to the web server.\n",

      "*   Llama 3 Model: The AI model that generates responses to user messages.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Setting Up the Messenger Chatbot\n",
      "\n",
      "To set up the Messenger chatbot, follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Create a Facebook Business Page**: Create a Facebook business page for your business.\n",
      "2.  **Create a Facebook Developer Account**: Create a Facebook developer account and register your application.\n",
      "3.  **Set Up the Messenger Platform**: Set up the Messenger Platform for your application and configure the webhook settings.\n",
      "4.  **Set Up the Web Server**: Set up a web server (e.g., Amazon EC2 instance) to receive webhook events from the Messenger Platform.\n",
      "5.  **Integrate with Llama 3**: Integrate the Llama 3 model with your web server to generate responses to user messages.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Configuring the Webhook\n",
      "\n",
      "To configure the webhook, follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  Go to the Facebook Developer Dashboard and navigate to the Messenger Platform settings.\n",
      "2.  Click on \"Webhooks\" and then click on \"Add Subscription\".\n",
      "3.  Enter the URL of your web server and select the \"messages\" and \"messaging_postbacks\" events.\n",
      "4.  Verify the webhook by clicking on \"Verify\" and entering the verification token.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Handling Webhook Events\n",
